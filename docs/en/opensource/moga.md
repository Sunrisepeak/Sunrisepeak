## Core Problems and Goals

> From the perspective of energy conservation, if an open source project **creates value > maintenance cost** resulting in positive value, then it has the foundation for sustainable development

- **Problem:** Some open source projects that have proven (or preliminarily proven) valuable still gradually disappear for various reasons
- **Goal:** Explore how individuals/organizations/communities can **sustainably develop/operate** an open source project and create social value

## Value Orientation

- **Vision:** Enable valuable open source projects to continuously develop and create social value
- **Mission:** Explore how to sustainably develop/operate an open source project, providing project maintainers with replicable/referenceable engineering, governance, funding and community operation methodologies and toolkits
- **Values:** Open Source Co-creation, Sincere Passion, Openness and Inclusion

## Current Problems in Open Source

- Project maintainer survival and sense of achievement issues
- Documentation and usability: Documentation lags or is incomplete, high entry barrier
- Promotion and influence: How to establish connections with target users, gain attention and feedback to form a virtuous cycle
- Contributor cultivation: High barrier for newcomers, unclear contribution paths, scattered communication, lack of maintainer cultivation mechanisms
- Community and ecosystem: How to establish communities and ecosystems around projects, and related operation and governance issues
- Difficulty in establishing commercialization paths for open source projects, making it hard to support sustainable project development
